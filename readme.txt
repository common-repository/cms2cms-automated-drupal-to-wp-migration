Drupal to WordPress automated data migration plugin. Convert Drupal to WordPress easily and fast.

== Description ==

You have a Drupal based website with a lot of data on it. Once you found that WordPress is a better place to be. Now you’re wondering how to move a valuable content from your Drupal website to WordPress. You’re also worried about how to perform the migration quickly and safely, since you’re a busy person or don’t know how to ‘code’.

= HOW THIS PLUGIN HELPS: =
- Run Free Demo Migration to see the migration results first;
- Choose which content items you want to move from Drupal to WordPress and where to locate them (‘data mapping’ option);
- Migration lasts for 15 min. But note that the migration time strongly depends on how many content items you’re up to transfer to WordPress;
- Migration price depends on the content amount you’re up to transfer to WordPress.

* Nodes (articles, static pages, etc.); content included there, nodes’ creation date, author and status;
* Content images;

* Users and their roles;
* Menu and menu items;

* Automated 301 redirects from existing Drupal website to the new WordPress website;
* Meta Data from existing Drupal website to WordPress
